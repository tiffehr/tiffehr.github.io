# Welcome!

This page is a work in progress, as I reduce my online presence for something more simple.

The majority of my professional work can be seen on [my NYT author page](https://www.nytimes.com/by/tiff-fehr). I am also [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffehr), albeit with an intentionally truncated history. Most other online profiles for me are placeholders or suspended.

If you are interested in my career and work, please reach out over email: this domain name on gmail.
