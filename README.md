# Welcome!

## `tiffehr.com` is in progress, but don't expect changes anytime soon

This is the online presence of Tiff Fehr, a data journalist and coder at The New York Times, within [the Interactive News desk](https://github.com/newsdev/about-int).


The majority of my professional work can be seen on [my NYT author page](https://www.nytimes.com/by/tiff-fehr). I am also [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffehr), albeit with an intentionally truncated history. Most other online profiles for me are placeholders or suspended.

If you are interested in my career and work, please reach out over email: this domain name on gmail.
