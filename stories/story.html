<h1>Yawning</h1>
<p>At 3:21 p.m. everybody yawned. Yawning rolled across the country by the projected timezones, targeting city residents, industrial areas and military complexes. &nbsp;It did not target medical centers. &nbsp;Observer patterns verified 93% compliance and the patterns promptly wiped awareness of the synchronicity with individual, more notable interruptions. &nbsp;5% subsequently stumbled, 5% sneezed, 5% blinked hard, 5% stretched their limbs, all depending on the individual&rsquo;s situation. &nbsp;5% yawned bigger a second time causing a sympathetic yawn from others. &nbsp;The event, as modeled, caused no deaths and only a handful of machine-operation errors with injury or damage. &nbsp;It ironed out anomalies where a 5% segmentation noticeably synced again, the aforementioned Harbin effect.</p>
<p>It was the largest mass test to date and considered a success. &nbsp;Approval for the test targeting military centers with synchronized blinking came quickly. &nbsp;The fraction of individuals who noticed and brought up the event more than twice to others were put on active watch&mdash;only two overlapped with military complexes.</p>
<p>The fourth phase of action patterns Permeated via paint on new pass-cards, this time specifically targeting militarized complexes within each insurgent state. &nbsp;The southeast presented a problem, shifting military leadership so quickly they lost two sets of altered distribution orders. &nbsp;A special operation instead identified and neurologically infiltrated the printing facility to confuse shipments in their warehouse, which became particularly delicate operating in the red cordons of South Beijing. &nbsp;It was a shock which printing facilities the local brass&rsquo; staffers chose.</p>
<p>The permeation did its job. &nbsp;Gradually more brain chemistry summaries came online. &nbsp;While individuals slept&mdash;never subjects, understand, since the Harbin effect feedback&mdash;the neuro-shims set themselves in place near short-term memory centers, shorting out dreams until the observer patterns could confirm dreamless sleep. &nbsp;The unbalancing dreamlessness caused, well, a war-torn country collapsing into civil war put individuals under pressure.</p>
<p>They took time to identify but the Permeated in charge of staffing in the (now-named) secessionist militarized organizations found the growing unease of the two identified Resistors from the yawn test as grounds for dismissal. &nbsp;Further blink tests with memory interruption removed thirty more phase-four Resistors. &nbsp;Of those thirty-two, nearly half died or vanished when XXXXXXXXXXX fell to Zone Four troops, along with its militarized territory and people. &nbsp;Zone Four did not deploy nuclear weaponry, even small scale, in taking Zone Three&rsquo;s remaining targets.</p>
<p>When Zone Four&rsquo;s air units strafed Zone Five, the fail-safe&rsquo;s live activation arrived. &nbsp;Minders in Taiwan and occupied Mongolia patched into the signal repeaters above Zone Four, Submerged into to the panic on the ground at individual levels for some 2,500 souls at once. &nbsp;A commander&mdash;one identified as particularly erratic and hot-headed during dream analysis&mdash;gave an order to launch their missiles at XXXXXXXXXXX&rsquo;s red cordon, XXXXXXXXXXX and Taiwan. &nbsp;His two staffers shot him before a second word could pass his lips. &nbsp;Then the Minders shot each other&rsquo;s individuals as protocol demanded. &nbsp;The Minders themselves faced a difficult recovery, seeing God only knows what before they disconnected. &nbsp;But they averted massive casualties in the refugee-laden cities and an attack outside pre-war borders on Taiwan, bristling with its Humanitarian Coalition weaponry.</p>
<p>The operation was a success, the defeat of Zone Four&rsquo;s militarized command in a counter (non-nuclear) attack covered the key murder-suicides. &nbsp;International reporting condemned both invasions and their brutality toward civilians. &nbsp;Phase Five received secret approval from Coalition Operations to permeate India.</p>
