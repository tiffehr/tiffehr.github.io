<h1>Blue Heron</h1>
<p>"Looks like we&rsquo;ve got time to kill and I&rsquo;m tired of watching tail-lights. I have a story&mdash;the one dream I remember clearly. It starts in the mist just after dawn. I&rsquo;m walking on a beach leading to the bay, which isn&rsquo;t the main beach. It&rsquo;s over the causeway. In the bay the water is typically still. No tides. And with the mist everything&rsquo;s muffled like when it is snowing rather than fog. &nbsp;So we can&rsquo;t hear much beyond our own sand-shuffling.</p>
<p>Drew and I are heading down the bay beach to get to&hellip;someplace. I don&rsquo;t remember where but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;d be walking for awhile, no matter where we had to go. The mist rises and everything is pastels: the cream sand, the sharp blue dune grass, the grey water. The air is golden and bubbly, like champagne. Bits of mist eddy around shadows. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s really gorgeous.</p>
<p>We just walk along, looking around in awe. As time passes, something starts to tingle at the back of my mind. Something&rsquo;s off. I&rsquo;m looking at the colors, the trees, the water, trying to figure it out but I don&rsquo;t want to mention it to Drew in case it&rsquo;s nothing. He looks so peaceful.</p>
<p>We keep walking. I suddenly decide it&rsquo;s the sounds that are off. At this hour, we should hear the bay waking up around us&mdash;bugs, gulls, buoy&rsquo;s bells as fishermen start up. But it&rsquo;s completely quiet. Drew&rsquo;s starting to look uneasy, too. &nbsp;His smile is tight and small.</p>
<p>I catch his eye and he gives a shaky nod. We know not to speak but can&rsquo;t say why that&rsquo;s dangerous. We walk as quietly as we can. I can feel the fear radiating off the dunes and the water seems to lap it back on us, like an &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo; jeering.</p>
<p>A breeze silently ruffles the blade of grass I&rsquo;m frantically staring at and it hits me:</p>
<p>'Oh, shit. Blue heron.'</p>
<p>'RUN!'</p>
<p>I take off. I think I saw Drew go saucer-eyes just before he started sprinting, too. Now we&rsquo;re making a ton of noise, slamming up the beach as fast as we can run in the sand.</p>
<p>I hear an accelerating high-pitched shriek from overhead and BAM! sand explodes behind us, sending as shower of stuff and dust all over our backs. There&rsquo;s a concussion of air that flattens the grass and rings the water, pushing us forward an extra step. I hear this nails-on-chalkboard, deranged scream behind me as the heron climbs out of the sand and launches up in to the sky again. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the sound of pure fury. &nbsp;The dogfight whine picks up again, circling above us as we run. Then in turns for us, getting louder.</p>
<p>BAM!, the heron slams into the sand ahead of me a few paces, knocking us off our route and slowing our pace as we cough and flail at flying particles. The heron&rsquo;s head emerges from the crater&rsquo;s mushroom-cloud column of dust and it turns its head perpendicular to me to stare with one unnatural eye. &nbsp;Hell-heron. &nbsp;It screams again, louder, targeting me with its sound like a banshee. &nbsp;Launching itself skyward, it throws a bigger shadow with every wing-beat. &nbsp;It feels like the sand is cowering, too.</p>
<p>I catch Drew gesturing wildly and we start zig-zagging as we run, giving the heron a moving target.</p>
<p>It screams around above us and we hear the plummet start nearly at the edge of hearing. This one&rsquo;s gonna be huge. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll never survive.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>And then I wake up. I&rsquo;m not joking&mdash;that&rsquo;s exactly how it went. Four words: &ldquo;Oh, shit, blue heron&rdquo;. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re burned into my memory. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m pretty sure once I was fully awake I started laughing. &nbsp;I never understood where we were going, why or what pissed off the blue heron. Or why Drew. But it&rsquo;s the most vivid dream I ever had and I *still* get edgy walking that beach.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead, keep laughing. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
