<h1>2010 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>Happy 2011!</strong> The &lsquo;Aughts are behind us. About time, too. I have high expectations for 2011, simply because 2010 was so mercurial it cannot be sustained.</p>
<p><strong>Busy.</strong> This year&rsquo;s letter should elaborate on last years&rsquo; projects at msnbc.com but it is pretty boring, so here&rsquo;s the short, tired-of-talking-about-it version. Last year&rsquo;s big project redesigning our Story pages launched in June with a haze of long hours, last-minute pile-on and a big &ldquo;meh&rdquo; from our website visitors. Which is all fine. I learned a lot, our team evolved and we made radical changes to our underlying technologies that make the future bearable. So of course we&rsquo;re doing a similar project around NBC&rsquo;s Today Show. With a re-org in the works, TodayShow is our most stable audience so they get the cool, new toys.</p>

<p>Last year I reported on my house. Well it is still here, still mine and there&rsquo;s still no market for it. I did pick up a short-term tenant. My good friend Sadie moved in while finishing her dissertation. Moulson and I are grateful for the company, however her dissertation is nearly done (in committee!). One of my coworkers had the good sense to ask Sadie to marry him, so she&rsquo;ll be moving out sometime soon either way. Their wedding is a family-only affair so I can&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;I object!&rdquo;, just to keep a great roommate. Which is probably best for all concerned.</p>
<p><strong>Moulson is doing quite well, thank you for asking.</strong> After a year of living together he finally feels comfortable enough to show some personality. That personality consists of fussiness around mud (fine by me), sleeping in later than me (also fine by me), a deep sigh+whine when I leave him at home (heart-breaking) and a long-suffering grumble&mdash;but no longer fear&mdash;when I flop him over for a belly rub. He&rsquo;s a normal dog again, albeit one that&rsquo;s terrified of the toaster and hissing noises. I can&rsquo;t toast anything but that seems a decent trade-off for a great dog. He goes to work one day a week and is genuinely loved by all.</p>
<p><strong>Family, and loss thereof.</strong> This year was tough. My mother&rsquo;s mother passed suddenly in April, losing a short battle with pneumonia at the age of 92. Grandmother was not an easy lady to get along with but it was a tribute to her role in our lives that I shared rums &amp; cokes&mdash;Grandmother&rsquo;s signature drink&mdash;with my entire family gathered for her memorial in Colorado. Then in September my aunt Jill lost her long-waged battle with cancer. Seeing the strength and respect in her network of friends and family at her memorial in the Bay Area was bittersweet and lovely&mdash;I wish I&rsquo;d known her better. Lastly, just before Christmas we lost Kas, my dad&rsquo;s cousin, who served the role of an (awesome) aunt as well as the unofficial tyrant of Jackson, Wyoming. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer just weeks before her death. I&rsquo;m still a bit numb, in part because she specified no grave or memorial. It will take time before we can gather in Wyoming to spread her ashes and say a quiet goodbye.</p>
<p>After that unfortunate tally, I&rsquo;m happy to report that the rest of my family is uneventfully doing well and I have nothing to report.</p>
<p><strong>Travel.</strong> 2010 is going to be a hard year to top in terms of travel but I have hopes 2011 will be close. I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers for less travel for sudden family events. While I enjoyed all the places and people I visited this year, three stand out:</p>
<ol>
<li>An epic three-week-long European tour with my parents, uncle and cousins and cousins-once-removed, starting in Barcelona then visiting Carcassonne, a villa in Tuscany, Balsano, Munich and Prague. Sun, food, drinks, trains, a stylish minivan, amazing sights, great company and the unfortunate habit of remembering handy phrases like &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo; and &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in the country *after* it would have been best put to use.<br /><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/X1_Gq-LVN1TTR0BCQckzLENF0DW5W9al-Z4cJwQyGRawcrSCnwoBraLbhi3Ks_3CCklwf2BSSkYGYpmserqx4NMYH7SF5TyCv3P3yRtGWAnLUa7Y" /></li>
<li>Halloween at the House on the Rock, a roadside attraction outside Madison, Wisconsin and just past Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s cult-like Taliesin estate. The House is impossible to explain succinctly&mdash;it&rsquo;s a non-museum recombination of stuff into a massive maze, literally built up as more people came to see it. Like a temple to (and made of) America&rsquo;s collecting instincts. I&rsquo;ve wanted to visit since I read a book called &ldquo;American Gods&rdquo; wherein it figures prominently. I&rsquo;m hardly alone in that: the weekend visit was timed to join my good friends Jaime and Willie so we could attend a series of fan-created events with the author of the book. And an epic Halloween party, to boot. It was unlike anything I&rsquo;ll get to do again.</li>
<li>At the end of the year I got to spend a brief week in the paradise of Troncones, Mexico for the wedding of two good friends, Lisa and John. In the middle of Seattle&rsquo;s soggy, cold winter, a week in perfect weather with an awesome group seemed like a dream. The only reminder of reality was stepping on a stingray and being stung in the foot for doing so. Non-mortal; it&rsquo;s healing up just fine but it sure hurt for a bit. Stingray neurotoxin is unpleasant.</li>
</ol>
