<h1>2008 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>Happy 2009! </strong> 2008 marked my best holiday letter format to date, so I decided to copy the format this year. I&rsquo;m glad I looked at my previous letters. Is it a good thing or a bad thing that recalling 2008 is hard without memory aids? Regardless, it is truly remarkable how 2008 progressed&mdash;both surprisingly busy and static.</p>
<p><strong>Busy.</strong> I find it funny my &lsquo;07 letter warned that I&rsquo;d be a workaholic this year. That was very true&mdash;I really, really like my job and that&rsquo;s very rewarding to admit. I started at msnbc.com (in Redmond on Microsoft&rsquo;s soulless suburban campus) in late August of &lsquo;07, and immediately helped launch a site redesign. The redesign was a strong success, which propelled my team into a prominent position in the company&hellip;just in time for this year&rsquo;s remarkable news cycle: the Iraq war continuation, devastating cyclones and earthquakes, a Summer Olympics, two Gulf hurricanes, the Large Hadron Collider, an all-consuming, amazing Election and massive financial collapse. Not to mention many smaller, remarkable stories and high-speed car chases in midwest cities (for which we gather around newsroom TVs and admire the inevitable finality of spike strips). Over the year, my colleagues and I won the hierarchical respect of having our 15-person design team made into its own department. It represents a big change for the company&hellip;right in time for what should be a truly lousy year of cutbacks and slashed budgets in &lsquo;09.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hard at work on some big projects that should counter some downturn effects, one of which is reconsidering how people read news stories on the web (my main focus these days). In our usual style, my colleagues and I have widened that project into a new ad model for the Web, an entity extraction engine (don&rsquo;t ask), various passive recommendation systems and a time-based evolution to news coverage that we don&rsquo;t know quite how to tie to a metaphor that is not a natural disaster. (I hope to post some prototype URLs to Twitter, for those of you familiar with the service.) In short, workaholism will extend&mdash;happily&mdash;into &lsquo;09.</p>
<p><strong>Static.</strong> &lsquo;08 has been rather frustrating on one front&mdash;my damn house. Although I kicked out my tenants a while ago, it took a year of weekends to get my house in shape for market. I got it listed just in time for Seattle to start its delayed housing downturn, followed quickly by the financial crisis and a halt to all things credit-based. Though the place is now on the market&mdash;5026Seventh.com&mdash;I&rsquo;ve learned it&rsquo;s not a compelling property for the area&rsquo;s remaining agents who prefer easy, panicky sells. I also learned that I know more about the local market than most agents do. They don&rsquo;t handle my questions, statistics and numbers-based perspective well. That being said, I expect &lsquo;10* will find me comfortably renting while I watch my house&rsquo;s profit waver at the whim of the market crises in a less direct manner.</p>
<p><strong>Family, etc.</strong> On the family front, it has been a happily quiet year. The biggest news is my brother bought a bagel shop in Jeremy Ranch/Kimball Junction, Utah&mdash;just down the street from the ski resorts. It was his favorite pre-skiing lunch spot. When the owner put it up for sale Adam found his small-business-owner calling. It is doing very well already&mdash;they&rsquo;ve expanded into pies, pastries and gourmet soups, with an eye toward take-home meals. On my parents&rsquo; end of things, they moved two blocks from their current condo to a much bigger condo with a better view. Each parent and each pet have their own floor. It is even more ski-lodge style than the last place.</p>
