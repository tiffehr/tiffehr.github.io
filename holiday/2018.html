<h1>2018 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>2018:&nbsp; At Least It&rsquo;s Over&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Work continues to be intensive.</strong>&nbsp; The &ldquo;failing&rdquo; New York Times is still not failing! And it continues to be an adventure.&nbsp; This year was an even-numbered year, meaning we had both an Olympiad and a U.S. federal election &mdash; Winter and Midterms, respectively.&nbsp; Those two data-heavy events bookended the year for me and my news-nerd colleagues.&nbsp; My own beat shifted from breaking-news tools to document-analysis tools.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rather boring to describe more than that, but that&rsquo;s par for non-glamorous but essential work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2019 should be very eventful &mdash; for me, The Times and the news.&nbsp; Be ready for another rollercoaster year.</p>
<p><strong>Family &amp; Travel.&nbsp;</strong> Mom&rsquo;s health continues to decline, particularly in mobility and speech.&nbsp; In March it came time to move her to an assisted living facility in Salt Lake. She has great support there, with a rotation of personal nurses, facility staff and Dad collectively providing round-the-clock care.&nbsp; She has a wheelchair-friendly studio and has made friends among the residents.&nbsp; Dad and his bottles of homebrew are a hit, too.&nbsp; She is upset about her health but agrees assisted living is the right place (most of the time).</p>
<p>Dad continues to travel, on doctor&rsquo;s orders to take breaks from nearly full-time caretaking. Those recuperations have focused on our Mexico timeshare. Subsequently, I have focused my own travel on Mexico and Utah.&nbsp; In fact, I&rsquo;m writing you from Utah, where we have brought mom home for the holidays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My personal trip this year was to Scotland, with my favorite traveling buddies Jaime &amp; Willie. We did a quick tour from London to Edinburgh to the Highlands to the Isle of Skye, concluding in Glasgow.&nbsp; I worked on my appreciation of local beer, scotch and left-side driving.&nbsp; We loved Scotland and its people, though perhaps not its one-lane, tourist-infested roads which were routinely terrifying.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon &amp; Behemoth gained a Lioness!&nbsp;</strong> I am a cat lady now.&nbsp; Three cats was my mental limit, which I crossed this year.&nbsp; Please allow me to introduce my unintentional cat, Lioness!&nbsp; She came with the name and is a &ldquo;foster failure&rdquo;.&nbsp; Not due to her charms or personality &mdash; in fact, the opposite.&nbsp; She is a challenging rescue case:&nbsp; very scared of humans and extremely wary of life.</p>
<p>The ASPCA realized I&rsquo;m good with difficult cats and had I not adopted her, she would have been put down since they can&rsquo;t return her to the streets.&nbsp; After rehabbing Behemoth to quasi-normal cathood over two years, I felt Lioness needed more time to understand the perks of domestication.</p>
<p>After six months, she is starting to show signs of contentment and trust.&nbsp; She lets me pet her on the head and I can veerry sloowwly pick her up for some brushing of her lovely longhair coat.&nbsp; At night she strolls around the apartment and ignores Dragon and Behemoth.&nbsp; They all get along, but none of them are yet aware she will be the boss someday, once she has grown more confident.&nbsp; Expect a progress report next year!</p>
<p>Beyond fostering, I continued volunteering at the ASPCA all year.&nbsp; I kept up reading to traumatized dogs, but also spent summer and fall in the Kitten Nursery, where newborn litters go through care, quarantine and evaluation before adoption.&nbsp; The Nursery sees more than 2,000 kittens each year.&nbsp; My role is Kitten Socialization, which means I play and cuddle with them to get them to trust humans.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a perfect counter to working in news, in spending hours with purring fuzzballs who are delighted with a feather toy.&nbsp; I will definitely return to the Kitten Nursery in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>I moved!&nbsp;</strong> With increasing subway problems and more volunteering, it came time to reconsider the costs and benefits of living in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Seven years in my neighborhood was comfortable but I was taking it for granted.&nbsp; My idle research about apartments in Yorkville, Manhattan (near the ASPCA; I already knew the area well) turned into visiting open houses which turned into applying for a new place.&nbsp; We moved in early December.&nbsp; The cats were not pleased but at the year&rsquo;s end, we&rsquo;re mostly settled in.&nbsp; My commutes are a fraction of my previous train time and the building is more comfortable and friendly.&nbsp; And p.s., here&rsquo;s <a href="http://a.co/ebib7w8" target="_blank">my housewarming present list</a>, if you feel so inclined.</p>
<p><strong>May next year pass quickly for us all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Best of 2018</strong>, by arbitrary categories and in no particular order&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Theater &bull;&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The Ferryman&rdquo;, a stunning play about a family in the whirlwind of the Northern Ireland Troubles &bull;&nbsp;&ldquo;The Lifespan of a Fact&rdquo;, a stellar three-person show about journalism, truth and storytelling and featuring Harry Potter, Bobby Cannavale but most importantly Cherry Jones &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tina&rdquo;, the Tina Turner jukebox musical currently in London but coming to Broadway in 2019 &bull; &ldquo;Come From Away&rdquo;, a new Broadway staple and an utterly charming story about the small-town residents of Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador who ended up hosting thousands of air-traffic refugees in the immediate aftermath of 9/11&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Books &bull;&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm: A New English Version&rdquo;, by Philip Pullman, his edits of Grimm fairy tales are glorious to read &bull;&nbsp;the Crazy Rich Asians trilogy, by Kevin Kwan, good, escapist fun and now a hit movie &bull;&nbsp;I read a couple of series this year which were time consuming but nothing I would recommend broadly&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Media &bull;&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The Fourth Estate&rdquo;, a documentary series about The NYT that aired on Showtime &bull;&nbsp;<em>Stay Tuned</em>, a new law &amp; politics podcast hosted by former SDNY attorney general, Preet Bharara &bull;&nbsp;the best of <em>The Weekly Standard</em>, a stalwart conservative magazine that housed the &ldquo;Never Trump&rdquo; conservative wing only to be killed and cannibalized mid-December by its Trump-backing billionaire owner (it is a good time to find and follow conservative viewpoints, since conservatism is separating the wheat from the chaff in ideology v. party) &bull;&nbsp;<em>Slow Burn</em>, Season 2, by Leon Neyfakh of Slate, about the Clinton impeachment scandals, which I followed but didn&rsquo;t really understand; I recommend Season 1 about Watergate, too</p>
