<h1>2014 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>2014: &nbsp;Not my best balancing of work/life but A+ comp time!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Work was a lot.</strong> &nbsp;The volume of major news events scheduled on even-numbered years makes for some time-intensive, high-profile combinations. &nbsp;2014 saw me working the <a href="http://sochi2014.nytimes.com/">Sochi Winter Olympics</a>, all six weeks of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/sports/worldcup/best-of-world-cup.html">men&rsquo;s World Cup</a> and the <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/liveblog">U.S. midterm elections</a>. &nbsp;Each are big efforts on their own; combined&hellip;well, I banked a lot of comp time.</p>
<p>Between the big events, I helped on the launches of two new NYT sub-brands: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/upshot">The Upshot</a>, data-oriented slice of economics, politics and sports; and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/first-draft">First Draft</a>, a newsletter/daily live-blog for U.S. politics. &nbsp;And in case that sounds like room to breathe, I also spent most of late May living in a hotel in the French Quarter of New Orleans, training j-school students in an <a href="http://www.nytimes-institute.com/">intensive, two-week newspaper bootcamp run by The Times</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>May 2015 be as challenging&mdash;but more sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Moulson is now a cancer survivor.</strong> &nbsp;My repeated gags about Moulson&rsquo;s old age took its revenge this year. &nbsp;Mo was diagnosed with lymphoma, via one minor tumor. &nbsp;Two surgeries removed it, yet lymphoma is the kind of cancer that will return. &nbsp;Mo took advantage of his recovery time to amplify his &lsquo;old man&rsquo; habits, of course. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s now pretty much a cat, sleeping on the couch by our warmest winter radiator. &nbsp;Rest assured we have some quality time to spend together yet.</p>

<p><strong>My family expanded their horizons.</strong> My brother Adam opened a second bagel shop, taking another step toward his bagel empire. &nbsp;My parents toured Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Slovenia, Mexico, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Belize. &nbsp;In their own holiday letter, Mom finally shared some details about her health. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s dealing with a Parkinsonian dementia&mdash;a rare version called corticobasal degeneration. &nbsp;Mom has a phalanx of therapists helping her adjust to diminished abilities on a few fronts. &nbsp;My dad&rsquo;s patient care makes a huge difference as well. &nbsp;Mom enjoys the stimulation and activity of traveling, so 2015 already includes another international tour or two for them.</p>
<p><strong>My own vacation time was diverse.</strong> &nbsp;I attended two notable weddings this year: &nbsp;a whirlwind trip to Cape Town, South Africa and a too-short return to Seattle. &nbsp;Cape Town was fantastic. &nbsp;I spent my birthday on the top of Table Mountain, waving at giant container ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope. &nbsp;My brief return to Seattle was complex. &nbsp;Mo* and I flew to Utah, then I drove up to Seattle. &nbsp;Mo stayed with my parents, providing some healing time since they lost their dog earlier this year to cancer (damned cancer). &nbsp;Both Seattle and the wedding were fantastic. &nbsp;I dearly miss it and my friends there&mdash;thankfully all are doing just fine.</p>
<p>Lastly, I spent part of November living as a retiree with my parents in Mexico&rsquo;s timeshare racket. &nbsp;My parents also timeshared a grandchild, in a way. &nbsp;Long story short: &nbsp;three years ago my good friends Lisa &amp; John joined us in Mexico. &nbsp;At the time Lisa was seven months pregnant. &nbsp;This year they joined us again, along with their son, Milo. &nbsp;Mom and Dad were delighted. &nbsp;We learned it takes five adults to keep up with one toddler. &nbsp;After Milo &amp; family returned home, my parents and I moped around the resort, missing Milo&rsquo;s energy and pool-choice decisiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Best stuff of 2014.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>❅ &nbsp;May 2015 be an extended calm before the storm of 2016. &nbsp;❅</strong></p>
<p>* &nbsp;do not recommend&mdash;your pet may be fine but you&rsquo;ll be a wreck due to the airlines&rsquo; crap</p>
<p>** it&rsquo;s actually really good, that&rsquo;s not just me insisting it be after waiting so damned long</p>
