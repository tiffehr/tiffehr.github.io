<h1>2009 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>Happy 2010: The Future!</strong> It&rsquo;s a relief to say that. I&rsquo;m glad 2009 is over. It was a year of downgraded expectations and holding fast&mdash;little forward progress worth noting. So good riddence to the &rsquo;Aughts and on to the &lsquo;Terrible Teens&rsquo; (let&rsquo;s hope that name doesn&rsquo;t stick).</p>
<p><strong>Busy.</strong> This year&rsquo;s letter is shorter than previous years largely because I&rsquo;ve been immersed in long-term projects both at work and around my house. The kind that are boring to talk about. At msnbc.com, we&rsquo;re still hard at work on our story page redesign. The project has taken more than a year and led me into technologies I never intended to learn. It&rsquo;s been a challenge in many ways&mdash;both good and bad. I&rsquo;d share more details, however we&rsquo;re in the thick of it as I write this retrospective. More reflection on the news industry and company financials in my 2011 letter, to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding my house,</strong> I had for sale for a year but found no serious buyers. I got a lot of first-time buyers looking for rentable space/income but they bought dime-a-dozen townhomes instead. I&rsquo;ll try it again next year if Seattle&rsquo;s market comes around. The analysts I read seem to think Seattle is 10+ months behind other cities&rsquo; housing improvements (should you think any of them areimproving). Hopefully next year&rsquo;s letter will include significant progress on that front. I&rsquo;m ready to move to a more efficient urban footprint, though I do have a new housing-selection requirement&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>A Dog!</strong> After five years talk, I adopted a dog! He&rsquo;s a rescue dog&mdash;about 6 years old&mdash;named Moulson. He&rsquo;s had that name for at least a year or more so I&rsquo;m not at liberty to change it. Yes, I sound like a dumbass at the dog park, yelling for a dog who&rsquo;s name sounds like a crappy beer. But he is a great dog and other dog-park citizens envy his demeanor. He&rsquo;s had an unknown abusive past but is adjusting with remarkable swiftness to being a contented urban pet. Also: he&rsquo;s adorable (see photo). Expect my future New Year letters to include lots of dog reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Family.</strong> There is not much new to report on the family front. Mom and Dad are ensconced in their ski lodge home, volunteering like crazy while maintaining a mild-mannered retiree front. My brother Adam&rsquo;s bagel shop in Park City is doing well, though sadly he lost two employees (and friends) to a car collision this summer. The shop regulars made some amazing gestures of support.&nbsp; Both parents and brother are making the most of Park City, Utah.</p>
