<p><strong>2016: &nbsp;What a Miserable Excuse for a Year&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; Moulson passed away this year.</strong> &nbsp;In late March, Moulson suffered a second vestibular attack that impacted his ability to walk, spelling the end. &nbsp;I spent one more day with him &mdash; endless treats, hugs, ear-rubs and such &mdash; then our vet and I let him go. &nbsp;It was very sad but a merciful end for a good dog. &nbsp;He is missed by many.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon got a pet cat.</strong> &nbsp;A few months after Mo&rsquo;s passing, Dragon made his discontent known about being the lone pet. &nbsp;He did so by sitting on me in the middle of the night and meowing questions to which I had no answers. &nbsp;My interpretation: he needed a harassing figure in his life to enforce a pecking order. &nbsp;It is too soon for a new dog, so I got him a cat: &nbsp;a traumatized, adult street-rescue, now named <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffehr/status/735676480651431936">Behemoth</a>.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know much about Behemoth&rsquo;s background except he&rsquo;s very scared, very big and <em>very</em> slowly getting used to us. &nbsp;He may have been kept as a breeder because he is a rare <a href="#mce_temp_url#">Selkirk Rex</a>, which is a new natural breed known for a curly hair mutation. &nbsp;His fur looks like a worn, much-loved stuffed animal. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s disinclined to share his tragic backstory, which is fine. &nbsp;Like Moulson&rsquo;s painful past, we&rsquo;ll rehabilitate him without dwelling on things.</p>
<p>Behemoth and Dragon are already firm friends. &nbsp;They play and cuddle together, although Dragon is a lightweight compared to Behemoth. &nbsp;Dragon can pounce all he wants but Behemoth just looks bored and irritated, which amuses me to no end. &nbsp;Moulson would have approved of Behemoth&rsquo;s approach to life.</p>
<p><strong>Work was tough.</strong> &nbsp;This was year four of the four-year news cycle, the hardest year. &nbsp;The internet started calling 2016 &ldquo;the worst year&rdquo; around the time of Bowie&rsquo;s passing&hellip;on January 10th. &nbsp;And it just got worse. &nbsp;As jokesters observed on Twitter, not even Fidel Castro could outlive 2016. &nbsp;Overall, it was a big year for The NYT. &nbsp;I spent it focused on our live coverage tools, which were frequently in use between political events and sports, in particular. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw few breaks in the pace: &nbsp;all the usual yearly stuff, as well as a summer olympics and the bulk of a presidential election culminating in election night. &nbsp;I even published a rather nerdy story in the newspaper, about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/upshot/how-scalpers-make-their-millions-with-hamilton.html" target="_blank">scalpers profiting off the hit Broadway musical &ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo;</a>. &nbsp;The Summer Olympics and a General Election are two are big, multi-month efforts for my team, Interactive News. &nbsp;And we did some great work this year. &nbsp;Our website and data held up solidly for Election Night, which was a feat that should have made us proud but the election result and its implications for us squashed any interest in back-patting.</p>
<p>It was a ridiculously busy (and dispiriting) news year &mdash; let&rsquo;s not do that again, please.</p>
<p><strong>Family.</strong> &nbsp;Most of my traveling was dedicated to helping with my mom&rsquo;s declining health yet busy timeshare travel schedule. With my family, I spent some time in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where the resort layout works for Mom&rsquo;s new wheelchair. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be returning in 2017!</p>
<p><strong>I donated a kidney.</strong> &nbsp;Long story short, a fellow &ldquo;news nerd&rdquo; needed a kidney and we were a match, so I donated one of mine in mid-December. &nbsp;The transplant was successful! &nbsp;My recovery is ongoing even as edit this letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proud new owner of my kidney is an acquaintance (now friend), <a href="http://hellomykidney.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Michelle Minkoff</a>, who suffers an autoimmune disease that attacks her kidneys thereby limiting their lifespan. &nbsp;Eighteen months ago, her first donated kidney started to fail. &nbsp;She was a year away from getting on the transplant list and even further from finding a match. &nbsp;Being a very resourceful and relentlessly positive person, Michelle and friends set up a website and survey to find volunteers willing to be tested as a match. &nbsp;They promoted it on Twitter and Facebook, hoping to build a roster of candidates. &nbsp;Myself and around 50 others signed up. &nbsp;Her medical team was flummoxed by the response, as well as her proactivity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As Michelle&rsquo;s kidney function decreased throughout 2016, her medical support team started thinning the list of volunteers. &nbsp;A handful of us made the first cut. &nbsp;Tests confirmed I was her best match, which had felt inevitable to me from the very start anyways. &nbsp;In early December, I flew to Chicago and the hospital performed the transplant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The long-term impact of having just one kidney is surprisingly minimal. &nbsp;The remaining kidney grows to provide up to 75% of the previous functionality of two. &nbsp;Post-surgery treatment is Tylenol for pain&hellip;and that&rsquo;s about it. &nbsp;Until the incisions heal, no lifting &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; things. (I can pick up Dragon but not Behemoth, per guidelines.) &nbsp;Watch excess salt. &nbsp;Keep a healthy lifestyle, etc. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m much healthier than the average donor &mdash; I&rsquo;m definitely grateful for that.</p>
<p>Michelle is doing very well with her recovery, too. &nbsp;Please send spare karma and good wishes her direction!</p>
