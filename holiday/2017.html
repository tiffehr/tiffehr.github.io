<h1>2017 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p>2017: &nbsp;Personally Better than 2016 But a Mess Nonetheless</p>
<p><strong>Work was all-consuming.</strong></p>
<p>Life at the &ldquo;failing&rdquo; New York Times has definitely been an adventure this year. &nbsp;We are not failing, you may be surprised to learn &mdash;&nbsp;in fact we&rsquo;re doing quite well. &nbsp;But it has been a rollercoaster of a year. Each day&rsquo;s reporting has been a reaffirmation of why I love this newspaper. &nbsp;I am grateful to support colleagues (even passively) as they report about the Trump Administration, domestic politics as well as investigations like those culminating in the Harvey Weinstein revelations and our #metoo moment.</p>
<p>2018 will be busy, starting with a Winter Olympics just south of a hostile nuclear power and wrapping up with a balance-of-power midterm election in the U.S. &nbsp;My role will be supporting all of that. I expect to be working a <em>lot</em> and that seems appropriate to the credibility challenges facing main-stream media overall.</p>
<p><strong>Family.</strong></p>
<p>Mom&rsquo;s health continues to decline, as expected. &nbsp;She is now in a full-time wheelchair and we have part-time health care aides at home. &nbsp;In the spring and autumn, we made our usual timeshare pilgrimages to Mexico but the strain of that trip on Mom is increasing. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll see what early 2018 brings for travel versus amount of at-home care.</p>
<p>In September, I forced my dad to take a break from caretaking to join me and some friends at Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. &nbsp;(The doctors have been recommending such a break for him for some time.) During that trip, Mom did a &ldquo;respite stay&rdquo; at a local assisted living facility which worked out quite well. &nbsp;Her concerns about such a facility are reduced; Dad got a break, as well as a chance to see the utter circus that is Oktoberfest. Verdict, from both: worth doing once and perhaps only once.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon &amp; Behemoth are doing well, thank you. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When I first got my dog Moulson, it took about a year for him to come out of his post-trauma shell. &nbsp;Behemoth has now had more than a year and seems to have a better outlook on life. He sometimes purrs, he likes his basket bed and he looks to Dragon for cues about everything. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s not expressive but he&rsquo;s content. We can all handle that.</p>
<p>This year I also started volunteering at the ASPCA, the main city shelter and the organization&rsquo;s national headquarters. &nbsp;It is a very rigorous and training-oriented place and I appreciate that a lot. After four months volunteering, I&rsquo;ve done enough classes and hours to read to traumatized dogs, socialize (read: play with) kittens and take the most social dogs for walks. &nbsp;Of course I shall level up, but it is already very rewarding. In a city with so many people in your space, volunteering with animals is the right way to go.</p>
<p>To mess with Dragon &amp; Behemoth&rsquo;s little world (they deserve it), I am fostering a kitten named Annabelle&nbsp;for the holidays. &nbsp;She is a six-month-old who fell 13 stories out of a building and severely damaged her back legs. She is recovering from surgery. &nbsp;I attend to her daily meds and supervised exercise time. She is already the boss of the cats. I hope she is the beginning of a number of fosters, since Dragon &amp; Behemoth seem to handle guests decently. &nbsp;Maybe someday I can foster some dogs! One can dream.</p>
<p><strong>I recovered from kidney donation.</strong></p>
<p>One year after our surgery, I tend to forget about the entire kidney donation process for weeks at a time. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m still very happy to have done it and even more happy to have no day-to-day lingering effects to remind me.</p>
