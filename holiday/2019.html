<h1>2019 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>2019: Five Years for the Price of One?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Work accelerates once again.</strong> The New York Times continues to not fail! Shocking, I know. In fact, we&rsquo;re handling strong reader interest around the impeachment, solid subscription activity and meeting goals around growth&hellip;in addition to the usual world-class journalism. News companies are facing some serious headwinds over the next few years but The Times is decently positioned to weather much of it. We&rsquo;re heading into the toughest year of the four-year &ldquo;news cycle&rdquo;; 2020 brings us regular events like Super Bowls, Oscars and extreme weather but also a Summer Olympics and a general election in November.</p>
<p>All my holiday letters include this, but I expect to be exceptionally busy in 2020, working on our document-driven reporting toolset, live politics chats and eventually the election itself.</p>
<p><strong>Family &amp; Travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Mom&rsquo;s health continues to decline but includes some plateaus we can manage. She has grown to like her assisted-living facility as well as her &ldquo;Tongan Army&rdquo;. The &ldquo;army&rdquo; is an extended family of Tongan-American nurses who cover dayside, with the facility staff taking nightside. The lovely Laloni family &mdash; cousins of pro golfer Tony Finau and two NFL players &mdash; include the matriarch, her daughter-in-law, two granddaughters and other draftees as needed. In classic form, Dad is helping the army set up their own business, in addition to taking on other Abbington clients. They all adore Mom and even took her to a traditional islander pig roast feast for Thanksgiving as a special guest.</p>
<p>Mom is now reliant on her wheelchair and full assists for standing, which limits where she can go safely. So this year most of my travel was work-related or to be with family. Dad is still on doctor&rsquo;s orders to reduce his care-taking load, so my non-Utah trips included supervision of him (mom&rsquo;s orders) at the Mexico timeshare as well as a shoulder-season visit to the Jersey Shore to see old family friends.</p>
<p><strong>My three cats are well.</strong> Three! That&rsquo;s absurd. SMH. Dragon is his usual normal-cat goofy self (see photo, below). Behemoth&rsquo;s food-related neuroses are getting worse, but the poor lump also has kidney disease so I&rsquo;ll be shifting his care towards &ldquo;fospice&rdquo; (feline hospice), come time. Lioness, my mostly-feral cat, is coming around quickly after we crossed our one-year ownership anniversary in July. I can pick her up; she tolerates nail trims, brushes and baths. Sometimes she accepts full-body pets, too. But still no purring or kneading, so I&rsquo;ll keep working on her. There&rsquo;s a normal cat in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Like last year, I spent most of my volunteer hours in the ASPCA&rsquo;s Kitten Nursery. We saw ~1,200 kittens this year, but most were quickly shuttled to foster homes until they were ready for spay/neuter &amp; adoption. Due to the fostering emphasis, my volunteer duties changed; I became a Nursery Concierge. Sounds fancy, but I was a glorified servant to kittens and/or staff. I handled supplies, cleaning, intake (humans &amp; cats), vet evals and some butt baths (long story). And I also had moments to socialize the kittens, teaching them the perks of humans like warm laps and good pets. It continues to be an ideal antidote to working in news. I plan to do it again next year!</p>
<p><strong>Yorkville is good.</strong> My new neighborhood is growing on me. My apartment is a bit drafty, but I have prevention rituals and a drafty winter means a temperate summer. The ASPCA is five minutes away, rather than 60+ minutes, which helps me better balance work, volunteering and other hobbies. I have a nice park nearby, a gym and I may add fencing lessons &mdash; in classic NYC form, the ground floor of my building has a bodega, a dry cleaner and a world-class fencing school. Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>May 2020 get us all back on track.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Best of 2019</strong>, in no particular order</p>
<p><strong>Theater/Music&nbsp;</strong>&bull;&nbsp; I forgot a notable 2018 play: seeing <a href="https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/othello-starring-andre-holland-mark-rylance-review-shakespeares-globe-london/"><em>Othello</em> at The Globe theater</a> in London, with Mark Rylance and Andre Holland (!)
