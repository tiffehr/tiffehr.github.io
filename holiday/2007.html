<p><strong>Happy 2008!</strong> I know I&rsquo;m remiss in timely holiday letters for both 2006 and 2007, but I hope you&rsquo;ll accept a happy-new-year letter instead. The past two years have truly felt like one long year, anyway. &rsquo;06-07 brought many changes into my life. On the career front, &rsquo;06 was lousy but &rsquo;07 more than made up for it. 2007&rsquo;s progress came from the fact I joined the all-volunteer staff of Digital Web Magazine (digital-web.com), a leading online publication for web geeks like myself. Through Digital Web, I attended some top-notch web conferences including the geekily fantastic South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, TX (which precedes the much-better-know SXSW Music festival). Due to such events, I have the good fortune to count many of the movers and shakers in my industry as professional contacts and even good friends. My new-found network have already helped my career a lot, allowing me to make contacts within a new tier of tech companies. More on that in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>On the house front,</strong> 2007 has been a turning point in my slum-lord status. My house management skills faltered late &rsquo;06 as I grew tired of living with six other people. Around the same time, the Seattle housing market peaked so I began to consider moving. I had the house re-sided and painted, and we&rsquo;re steadily working on the inside for show this coming spring. By &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean my new trio of handy-around-the-house housemates&mdash;old friends Jake and Lucas, as well as Lucas&rsquo; three-year-old son, Per. Per (pronounced &ldquo;pear&rdquo;; germanic for rock) lives with us part-time though it has been a blessing to participate in his little, cheery life for the past few months. We taught Per to get us &ldquo;adult juice&rdquo; from the fridge (beer, of course) and we&rsquo;re also teaching him all kinds of literary phrases he shouldn&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>On the family front,</strong> my father finally re-retired from his in-retirement CTO role at an alternative-energy company. During the year, the company shifted from efficient engine components to geothermal power generation. Not to be outdone in retirement, my mother took her outrage over roadkill to new heights, forming a wildlife protection non-profit that is reshaping land use around animal migration corridors in the county surrounding Park City, Utah. My brother spent the year working, raising his giant horse-sized dog Hobbes and morally supporting his wonderful girlfriend Charli as she aced the Salt Lake City police academy&mdash;top shooter in her class. So, all in all,the family had a good year.</p>
<p><strong>Going back to the career front,</strong> in early 2006 I began working for Trails.com, a classic weird Seattle startup. Mid-&rsquo;06, Trails was bought by an L.A.-based &ldquo;new media&rdquo; group led by some &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; executives (quotes ironic). I had high hopes for changes within Trails&rsquo; apathetic approach to product development, but it was not to be. I parted ways with Trails mid-May, and took a summer sabbatical to thoroughly ponder my next career move. Job searching quickly became a full-time occupation, in part because my skills are currently in high demand&mdash;hard to argue with compared to previous years. But after years in the startup racket, I learned to value good colleagues above gilded business prospects. After a lot of thought, I turned down a few Bay Area job offers and joined msnbc.com in August. Although I now do the commute-of-geeky-shame to Microsoft&rsquo;s Redmond campus, my work and colleagues at msnbc.com are very rewarding. (I also really appreciate big company benefits and perks, which I didn&rsquo;t expect.) I&rsquo;m excited to see what 2008 brings by way of journalism, my work, my team members and life in general. While I may be in a workaholic phase for &rsquo;08, rest assured I&rsquo;m happy and will generously distract myself with more conferences, travel, moving and great friends &amp; loving family, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Best of&hellip;?</strong> In the build-up to this past holiday, I found myself inundated with endless published media &ldquo;Best of 2007&rdquo; lists and feeling a bit rebellious about the list format because of it. So in conjunction with my ongoing New Years resolution to avoid countdown programs on TV, I&rsquo;m only generally categorizing various highlights of &rsquo;06-07.</p>
