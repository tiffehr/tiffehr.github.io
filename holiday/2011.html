<h1>2011 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>Happy 2012!</strong> An informal poll* indicates 2011 was decidedly mixed-bag.</p>
<p>However I have high expectations for 2012 since the wave of change seems to be building rather than ebbing. I&rsquo;ll ride it as long as I can&hellip;which, if you&rsquo;ve seen me surf, is not a great metaphor selection.</p>
<p><strong>Busy</strong>&hellip;then a lull&hellip;then suddenly ridiculously busy. Like past letters I should highlight a few things career-wise. However this will be a mix of personal and career updates since 2011 proved them to be strongly linked.</p>
<p>January to March 2011 included the launch of another notable project at msnbc: the reworked &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; homepage for the TodayShow (today.com) which went quite well. At the time it was our best code to date and a proving ground for investments to come. However that project fed a departmental re-org that found me in a toothless role with not a lot to do. One consolation was changing offices to our Seattle space amid some of my favorite people rather than in Redmond. Yet after four big platform-improvement projects since 2007, waiting out the doldrums in a role I didn&rsquo;t like was demoralizing and stagnating, in many ways.</p>

<p>However, the doldrums did give me time to move! During the&nbsp;spring I turned my house into a rental property. Making it tenant-ready was long, intense and expensive even with a great property manager. Yet in July, Moulson and I moved to a friend&rsquo;s loft-like downtown condo (vacated for his own career move to San Diego) and a gaggle of undergrads infested my house (for a nicely marked-up rent). Between the new apartment, neighborhood and office-place, for a brief moment it felt like I moved to Seattle afresh rather than starting my twelfth year in the city.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an industry shrugging at the recession it would&nbsp;be tech and&mdash;even more so&mdash;hiring for the current bubble. Quite a few friends and colleagues changed jobs this year, all really good moves. Two awesome friends left Redmond for jobs in San Francisco, taking their even-more-awesome wives with them (one being my ex-roomie, Sadie). A handful of others moved offices, roles or cities, too, in a spate of summer restlessness. And just as I thought the changes were done for the year, the New York Times reached out to me about a role with their Tech team. Despite a (self-judged) terrible interview as Hurricane Irene bore down on the city, it seems the New York Times liked me a lot. Negotiations went well with the Times and less well with msnbc so I find I&rsquo;m sending this year&rsquo;s letter just a week before I move to Brooklyn, NY. Which is well beyond my expectations for 2011 in any scenario. It still seems unreal to me, despite artifacts like a ridiculous decision-making spreadsheet, one-way plane tickets and cardboard-box paper cuts.</p>
<p>Next year&rsquo;s letter will be quite different, no doubt. However, let&rsquo;s round this one out:</p>
<p><strong>Moulson</strong> is becoming a classic grouchy old man. He&rsquo;s somewhere above nine and has signs of joint issues and grey hairs beyond his muzzle. The grey hair doesn&rsquo;t limit his ability to pee on every blade of grass available so he doesn&rsquo;t really notice. Moulson has already partly moved: to spare him the stress of packing and plane travel, he&rsquo;s staying with my family in Utah for a few weeks, then my ever-so-kind Dad will drive him out to his new home. How&rsquo;s that for a spoiled rescue mutt?</p>
<p><strong>Family</strong> fared much better this year than last year. More or less everyone is fine. My parents and brother are enjoying Utah. My parents finally retired from ski patrol, giving them time to spend their winter in Mexico or skiing for fun rather than work. My brother Adam&rsquo;s bagel shop is doing well. The extended family is still extended. I&rsquo;m happy I have little else to report!</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong> in 2010 was a pretty epic travel year so 2011 seems tame by comparison. However, it did included one significant trip to the Middle East in late April and early May in the middle of the &ldquo;Arab spring&rdquo;. Best timing ever, right? Yes&hellip;and it was fascinating and rewarding. A good friend of mine, Lisa, kindly had me join her round-the-world tour for the Middle Eastern stretch from Jordan to Syria to Turkey. We spent three weeks first driving around Jordan in a rent-a-car, visiting endless Roman ruins, Crusader ruins, even-older ruins as well as modern-day marvels amid the cacophony of amazing cities and people. The second&nbsp;leg, Syria, was necessarily short: a flight into Aleppo and 36 hours wandering the souks and citadel, then a very brisk drive to the Turkish border. The last leg, Turkey, was its own adventure tempered by yet another inscrutable language, odd people, long bus rides and breathtaking landscapes. It was a great trip. Sadly, Syria may be beyond Americans&rsquo; reach for a while but I highly recommend Jordan and Turkey.</p>
