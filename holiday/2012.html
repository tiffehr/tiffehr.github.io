<h1>2012 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>Goodbye 2012!</strong> Holy cow what a year. Who keeps cramming all this into a single year? Me? Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>I find I have relocated.</strong> Last letter I alerted you to my move to New York City. That probably merits reflection: Manhattan is big, tall and busy. Brooklyn is shorter than Manhattan and less overwhelming. For their best-known attractions, I briefly visited to both the Bronx (Yankee stadium) and Queens (airports). I drove on a highway through Staten Island, though locals and I agree that doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>My Brooklyn apartment&mdash;once I wrested it from the clutches of another applicant&mdash;is well-situated for my commute with lots of great stuff nearby. It is a cozy refuge after weekdays in the whirlwind of Manhattan and Times Square. Work at The Times is both intense and rewarding. My first assignment was joining the in-progress team tasked with the london2012.nytimes.com Olympics microsite and the full immersion that demanded. &hellip;And six months later I began exploring the city for real. After &ldquo;Olys&rdquo; I worked on an investigation into <a href="http://nyti.ms/Xc2eNf">tax subsidies awarded by states to corporations</a>, organizing a lot of data into a public database. Nerd that I am, I enjoyed working on the series and it was well-received. I did not get to work on the 2012 Election coverage though I brought my hard-working teammates alcohol. (More or less the same thing with Hurricane Sandy.) This winter finds me building tools for our comment moderation team, which is peacefully not on deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Moulson</strong> adapted to Brooklyn immediately. He&rsquo;s still getting greyer (aren&rsquo;t we all?) but also more expressive. He loves his dog-walkers, who give him cheese. He likes our brownstone apartment and tree-lined street. He does not like the summer humidity or thunderstorms but he&rsquo;s learning how to cope. Mostly he seems to love how everything smells here. (I won&rsquo;t venture as to what it smells like.)</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong> took a backseat to relocating. However, I did save time for a great trip to Ireland with my dear friends Jaime &amp; Willie. We drove left-sided around the country drinking Guinness and/or whiskey, touring literary spots and megalithic sites while listening to silly county radio stations. What a great country&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait to return and regret I haven&rsquo;t visited before this year. Highlight: watching the All-Ireland Hurling finals, featuring Kilkenny v. Galway, in a locals-only Galway pub. Pub, sport and locals love at first sight. (Below, a proper Irish afternoon tea.)</p>

<p><strong>My extended family</strong> suffered another sad loss this year&mdash;an unexpected one. In October my uncle Lanny&rsquo;s lung disease took him from us just before his transplant scheduling, which is the definition of a crying shame. He passed as peacefully as he could after a short period of intensive care. The family gathered in the suburbs of DC for goodbyes and his memorial, which included a rather goofy wake brunch at an Irish pub over-decorated for Halloween (he would have enjoyed that). He&rsquo;ll be greatly missed.</p>
<p><strong>Reflecting on the lives of my friends</strong> scattered around the globe, it&rsquo;s been a event-filled year for us all. Statistically the year&rsquo;s career moves, babies, swiftly growing children and weddings should not surprise me yet it still does. My favorite event was Mike &amp; Chelan&rsquo;s San Diego wedding. A weekend of sunshine surrounded by most of my favorite people was a blessed interlude to a tumultuous year. The wedding itself was flawless and fun (and <a href="http://bit.ly/QPQHBt">written up</a>!) though I&rsquo;m most grateful to Mike &amp; Chelan for collecting my people in one place for me.</p>
<p>Lastly, my best of 2012 which is now losing its order and morphing into stuff I think I enjoyed this year regardless of when it actually came out&hellip;.</p>
