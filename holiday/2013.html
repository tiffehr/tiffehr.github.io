<h1>2013 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>Did 2013 seem a bit shor</strong>t, like we only got three-fifths of the year? &hellip;Just asking.</p>
<p><strong>2013 at The Times and NYC was quite diverse.</strong> &nbsp;Work kept me busy with many short-term projects&mdash;so many that few stand out beyond broad themes: &nbsp;the Oscars, NYC&rsquo;s mayoral race, homepage elements promoting special projects, some supplemental work for our Snowden/NSA coverage, etc. &nbsp;I made more friends and connections around the newsroom, improved my coding and enjoyed most of it. &nbsp;If you recall my last letter you probably think 2013 was a nice break after the full-immersion effort for the Summer Olympics. &nbsp;Yes, indeed! &nbsp;&hellip;However, we started on the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics four months ago. &nbsp;(It&rsquo;s much smaller, though.)</p>
<p>Regarding the city itself, I did a much better job exploring this year than last (because Olympics). &nbsp;I took the bus into New Jersey and (separately) Long Island. &nbsp;I took the subway to one of the northernmost stops, albeit still in Manhattan. &nbsp;I took the train up the coast to Boston, en route to Maine. &nbsp;I visited Yankee, Shea and Barclay&rsquo;s Stadiums and even attempted shopping on Madison Avenue very briefly before getting overwhelmed and hiding in a bookshop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet I&rsquo;m still just scratching the surface. &nbsp;Rest assured NYC will keep me entertained for quite some time to come.</p>
<p><strong>Moulson&rsquo;s doing just fine, thank you.</strong> &nbsp;He has more grey hair but seems content nonetheless. &nbsp;If he could talk beyond his expressive eyebrowing, he&rsquo;d no doubt share his pride in winning the pitched battle against his nemesis, the miscalibrated, whistling SW radiator. &nbsp;(I had the landlord fix it.) &nbsp;This year Moul spent a few weekends at an upstate cabin retreat owned by his dog-walker while I was away&mdash;how&rsquo;s that for a spoiled pup? &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t yet visited the Hudson Valley.</p>

<p><strong>New family member!</strong> &nbsp;My little brother Adam got married! &nbsp;It was a lovely wedding that included a ski lift, an everything-bagel wedding cake, a 170lb+ brindle mastiff ringbearer (see horse, below), a microdistillery and a small thunderstorm just as the ceremony ended. &nbsp;All of that was taken in glittery, platform-stiletto stride by my new sister-in-law, Liz Fehr* ne&eacute; Sorenson. &nbsp;She is a delight. &nbsp;Adam and Liz met while she managed the salon next to Adam&rsquo;s bagel shop. &nbsp;I know! &nbsp;Collective awww.</p>

<p><strong>Such luck! &nbsp;My friends came to me in 2013.</strong> &nbsp;My previous employer, msnbc.com, did me the favor of moving some of my favorite people from Seattle to New York. &nbsp;Of course, being a medium-sized venture folding into a gigantic corporation, the relocation trials and tribul&mdash;actually, no, there were no tribulations that I saw. &nbsp;Skipping the painful part, three separate families made the move to NYC with a fourth from Portland, OR, to further expand our post-Seattle enclave. &nbsp;2014 will see Moulson and me among long-term friends (human and canine) scattered around the outer boroughs and both of us exceedingly grateful. &nbsp;&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s in addition to an excellent group of friends and colleagues I&rsquo;ve made since I arrived here. &nbsp;For those of you not yet here: c&rsquo;mon over!</p>
<p><strong>Travel centered around family this year, for many reasons.</strong> &nbsp;I spent time with my parents in both Mexico and Utah, with as second trip to Utah for my brother&rsquo;s wedding. &nbsp;Another travel highlight was our annual college-group meetup in Nashville with its fierce reality TV and karaoke scene, plus work-related trips to Tucson and Atlanta. &nbsp;(I need to get out of the country again in 2014.)</p>
<p><strong>Best stuff of 2013.</strong> &nbsp;I blame the internet for distorting my sense of release dates of things. &nbsp;NOT age. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m pretty sure.</p>
