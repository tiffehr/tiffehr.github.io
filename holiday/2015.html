<h1>2015 Holiday Letter</h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;2015: &nbsp;The Year I Acknowledged I&rsquo;m Bad at Predicting the Next Year&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Work was all live, nearly all the time.</strong> &nbsp;My end-of-2014 assignment&mdash;supporting live new events like the World Cup and Midterm Elections&mdash;saw me promoted to &ldquo;senior&rdquo; dev lead for our live coverage. &nbsp;If our editors think a developing story deserves a liveblog, then I&rsquo;m working and/or on-call until it is done. &nbsp;Currently tally: 89 distinct live coverage scenarios since January. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s challenging and rewarding, yet rather intensive hours (sigh).</p>
<p>2016 will see improvements in our live coverage. &nbsp;I say &ldquo;will&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s my focus&mdash;the Rio Olympics (yay!), the Presidential Election 2016 (boo!) and everything else that arises. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll be a very busy year.</p>
<p><strong>Moulson</strong> is now indulging old age with Statler &amp; Waldorf levels of grump. &nbsp;In the wee hours of Dec. 23rd, 2014, Moulson suffered another age-related setback: sudden onset of vestibular disease, where his inner ear scrambled, resulting in severe vertigo. &nbsp;It looked a lot like a stroke, which was scary. &nbsp;However, Mo&rsquo;s treatment was blessedly easy: rest, time, low-dose dramamine and re-learning the effects of gravity.</p>
<p>Nearly a year later, Mo still lists a few degrees to port but that underpins other old-dog conditions like arthritis and spinal nerve degeneration (the curse of shepherds and shepherd-mixes). &nbsp;All things being even, he&rsquo;s a content old man, particularly with painkillers administered. &nbsp;He sleeps a lot and is generally at peace except&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>Meet Dragon!</strong> &nbsp;He&rsquo;s Moulson&rsquo;s cat. &nbsp;Shortly after Christmas, I adopted a cat, to serve as a transition pet once Mo passes on. &nbsp;The adoption came through while Mo was sick, but I think he&rsquo;s finally realized the cat is not a lingering hallucination. &nbsp;Dragon thinks Moulson&rsquo;s wagging tail is the best toy in the world; Moulson thinks the cat is a punk (we all agree). &nbsp;They pretend to dislike each other but sometimes I find them snuggling and listening to NPR.</p>
<p>Dragon&rsquo;s integration into the pack would be unremarkable were it not for his &ldquo;Winter Adventure&rdquo;. &nbsp;Just as our first big winter storm hit, Dragon snuck out as I was taking out the trash. &nbsp;Last bit I saw of him was his panicked tail, vanishing under a car buried in a tall snowdrift. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s a rescued feral kitten and part Maine Coon, so he&rsquo;s street-wise and winter-hardy&hellip; but it was the worst weather of the year, one big storm after another. And he&rsquo;s not that smart.</p>
<p>Every day I searched, put up posters, checked treat-caches, ran geo-targeted online ads and generally was a guilty wreck for the month he was gone. &nbsp;Most lost cats stay near home but Dragon was eventually seen over a mile away, across the heart of Brooklyn. &nbsp;My parents happened to be visiting, so one hour shy of exactly a month gone, Mom &amp; Dad got to meet their filthy, half-starved, yowling grandpet. &nbsp;They helped me clean my wounds earned in capturing him&mdash;Dragon was not pleased&hellip;until he saw his dog and started purring.</p>
<p>My apartment is now cat-proofed and Dragon is only allowed to sit on our porch under immediate supervision, in-harness and on-leash. &ldquo;Supermax&rdquo; security will be re-evaluated when he&rsquo;s five years old. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Family + Vacations</strong>. &nbsp;This year my vacation time centered around family and helping out with mom&rsquo;s health. &nbsp;In August, my parents celebrated their 50th Wedding Anniversary with 150 close friends and family &nbsp;in Utah. &nbsp;It was a multi-day affair and a lovely occasion that they enjoyed a lot. &nbsp;Dad throws a great party when he feels the need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, I joined my parents&mdash;as well as the &ldquo;timeshared&rdquo; grandkid, Milo, and his parents, Lisa &amp; John&mdash;in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, repeating last year&rsquo;s effort at playing retirees. &nbsp;We all tried to keep up with Milo. It was sunny and wonderful.</p>
<p>Adam&rsquo;s doing well, building his bagel shop empire and blogging his amazing outdoorsy life in Utah (I counter by grumping about subways). &nbsp;2016 should be a good year for his business and adventures&mdash;I&rsquo;m already jealous. &nbsp;I hope we can combine our vacations this coming year.</p>
<p><strong>Best of 2015.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
