<h1>County Tour</h1>
<p>Late summer of 2012, my good friends Jaime, Willie and myself traveled to the Ireland-shaped conceptual hole in my map of the world. I spent some time before, during and after the trip ruminating on why Ireland was a vague blankness to me compared to other places I&rsquo;ve traveled, because I <em>still</em> find it disconcerting.</p>

<p><em>Me, believing myself to be a cultured traveler yet still amused at playing King of the Rock.</em></p>
<p>Reviewing my travels without the sentimentality of myself as some cultured traveler&hellip;nearly all of them have been blind trips to places I know only in terms of geographic or political-boundary orientation. What I <em>like</em> to think of as knowledge is in fact a decent cartographic education in 7th grade&mdash;now showing its geopolitical age&mdash;plus vague facts from high school bullet-pointed histories.</p>
<p>And a LOT of desultory concepts gleaned from pop culture, movies and books. &nbsp;<em>Voila!</em> Presumed above-average knowledge just because I can name all the countries of the mid-&rsquo;90s political map in a song from &ldquo;Animaniacs&rdquo; (not a lie). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I do wonder if American history teachers assume students know Ireland&rsquo;s history from Irish-American immigrant caricatures, just because they are a notable pattern in our national history. (I vaguely remember a viewing of &ldquo;Far and Away&rdquo; in high school classes&hellip;but we also watched &ldquo;Tombstone&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s hard to recall clearly if either were the most resonant piece of a particular era of US history&mdash;I really hope they weren&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>But it may just be a quirk of my education. For a girl from a Scotch-Irish family (on one side), I ought to have absorbed at least as much context on the Irish side as the Scottish side. But I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m grateful to Ireland for patiently reshaping my concept of the country and people.</p>
<p>A last fit of musing: whatever education crossroads where people turn to reading Irish literature and authors in the larger context of Western literature, I missed that, too. Thankfully, Jaime and Willie had more than enough experience and interest to share. And I have a lengthy list of books by which to catch-up for next visit.</p>

<h2>Dublin</h2>
<p>We naturally started in Dublin. More specifically, a tour of Dublin&rsquo;s pubs led by a local musician and new-found friend. If you believe in single events setting a tenor for a trip, ours was set by our Guinness-fueled, lengthy conversations with local-compatriot JP about books, linguistics and the great vowel shift, Irish history and music as we journeyed pub to pub. It was a hell of a precedent to set.</p>
