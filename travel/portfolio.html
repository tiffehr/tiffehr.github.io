<h3>A third-party social widget API integration, client- and server-side</h3>
<p>First iteration recently released on all&nbsp;<a href="http://msnbc.com/">msnbc.com</a> and <a href="http://today.com/">today.com</a>&nbsp;Stories. &nbsp;The big gain is exposing their social-lift analytics back to our editorial teams as a starting point for conversations about social network leverage. &nbsp;But it made for a fun API project. <br /><br /> This one is a mix of server-side (C#), client-side (JS) and dependent markup and CSS. &nbsp;Only sample bits are included in the Gist, though.</p>

<h3>Live pages for &ldquo;epic&rdquo; projects</h3>
<p>I wrote the markup, foundational CSS and a chuck of the feature-specific JS in both&nbsp;<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43880728/ns/world_news-europe/t/german-tourist-rescued-teens-during-norwegian-island-massacre/">our recently revamped Story pages</a>&nbsp;(June 2010) and <a href="http://www.today.com/">the TodayShow cover</a>&nbsp;(March 2011). &nbsp;Some project highlights:</p>
<ul id="codeportfolio">
<li>strong emphasis on crisp markup and client-side performance, which achieved&nbsp;rather large performance gains in our rewritten front-end&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Today.com&rsquo;s relaunch&nbsp;was caught by Steve Souders&rsquo; HTTP Archive: &nbsp;<a href="http://httparchive.org/viewsite.php?pageid=302643#trends">http://httparchive.org/viewsite.php?pageid=302643#trends</a>&nbsp; (I&rsquo;m proud of those graphs.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Story layout variations based on ad scenarios and page content and story length, triggered by a series of signatures (as classes) on&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;
<ul>
<li><code>.RunOfSite.adX1</code> v. <code>.Sponsored.adX2</code> v. <code>.Sponsored.adX3</code>, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>some rather ridiculously complex JS for our slideshow &ldquo;slice&rdquo;, which has a (horrible) matrix of layouts based around image dimensions, viewport and ad intervals&mdash;best described in person</li>
<li>a vocabulary and styleguide for our IDs and classes between styling, JS-functionality hooks and our own semantics</li>
<li>an &ldquo;OOCSS&rdquo; effort for the TodayShow cover&nbsp;.block&nbsp;class layer, which I plan to simplify into something readable and send more details about</li>
<li>microdata, microformat and RDFa nerdery in our Stories</li>
</ul>
