“to discard from knowledge or memory; to give up knowledge of (something)”

“...we moderns can learn only if we always unlearn at the same time. Applied to the matter before us, we can learn thinking only if we radically unlearn what thinking has been traditionally.”
.credit[— [Heidegger, “Was Heißt Denken?”/“What Is Called Thinking”, 1954](http://hermitmusic.tripod.com/heidegger_thinking.pdf)]

“To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things every day.”

.lede[History must be curved,] for there is a horizon in the affairs of mankind. Beyond this horizon, events pass out of historical consciousness and into myth. Accounts are shortened, complexities sloughed off, analogous figures fused, traditions “abraded into anecdotes.” Real people become culture heroes: archetypical beings performing iconic deeds.
