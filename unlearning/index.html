# Skilled internet research

"to discard from knowledge or memory; to give up knowledge of (something)"
.credit[— Oxford English Dictionary]

“To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things every day.”
.credit[— Lao Tse]

“The most necessary part of learning is unlearning our errors.”
.credit[— Zeno]

"...we moderns can learn only if we always unlearn at the same time. Applied to the matter before us, we can learn thinking only if we radically unlearn what thinking has been traditionally." 
.credit[—[Heidegger, “Was Heißt Denken?”, 1954](http://hermitmusic.tripod.com/heidegger_thinking.pdf)]

"We must ask ourselves whether it is satisfactory, as thinking beings, to accept the present state of things constantly in a state of flux.  If we are to take these things at present value, without examining what it is that composes them or what lies hidden beneath their surfaces, we essentially have learned and thought nothing. We have simply seen a thing.  So, too, with ideas." 
.credit[—[Christopher Chamberlin, "Thinking and Building in a More Originary Way"](http://www.arch.ksu.edu/seamon/Chamberlin.htm)]

.lede[History must be curved,] for there is a horizon in the affairs of mankind. Beyond this horizon, events pass out of historical consciousness and into myth. Accounts are shortened, complexities sloughed off, analogous figures fused, traditions “abraded into anecdotes.” Real people become culture heroes: archetypical beings performing iconic deeds.
.credit[—Jan Vansina, [“Oral Tradition as History”](http://books.google.com/books/about/Oral_Tradition_as_History.html?id=J7wbS71dVbcC), 1985]
